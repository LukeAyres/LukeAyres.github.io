      <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. 
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to 
        provide programmatic control over them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such 
        as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing 
        it with additional objects; for example: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
          For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as 
          mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, 
          server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation 
          to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. 
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!--What You Should Already Know-->
    <section id="What_you_should_already_know" class="main-section">
      <header>What you should already know</header>
      <p>
        This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). 
        </li>
        <li>
          Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
        </li>
        <li>
          Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!--JavaScript And Java-->
    <section id="JavaScript_and_Java" class="main-section">
      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <p>
        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but 
        does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and 
        basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Hello World-->
    <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <p>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: 
      </p>
      <code>
        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
      </code> 
      <code>
        greetMe("World");
      </code>
      <p>
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! 
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Variables -->
    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform 
        to certain rules. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be 
        digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the 
        characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences 
        as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name. 
      </p>

    <!-- Declaring Variables-->
    <section id="Declaring_variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <p>
        You can declare a variable in three ways: 
      </p>
      <p>
        With the keyword var. For example, 
      </p>
      <code>
        var x = 42.
      </code>
      <p>
        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example, 
      </p>
      <code>
        x = 42.
      </code>
      <p>
        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With the keyword let. For example,
      </p>
      <code>
        let y = 13.
      </code>
      <p>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
