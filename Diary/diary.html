        <h2>Day One. (06/06/2020)</h2>
        <p>
          Started Free Code Camp (FCC) today, I've been a member for a while but this time I intend to complete their
          curriculum. I have so far finished the basic HTML section and have started the CSS section, to keep the 
          concepts fresh I've begun several side projects too (<a href="#">this game</a> and <a href="#">these basic tutorials</a>). <br>
          Now I'm learning styles with css, expect to see lots of absurd and tasteless color combinations and effects.  
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="day_two">
        <h2>Day Two. (10/06/2020)</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-header">Forms</h3>
        <p>
          To add a form to html we use the form tags: <br>
          <code>&ltform&gt &lt/form&gt</code>
          <br>
          Inside a form, input tags can be added to get input from the user and a button tag can be used for the user to send the form: <br>
          <code> &ltform&gt </code>
             <code> &ltinput&gt &lt/input&gt </code>
             <code> &ltbutton&gt Submit &lt/button&gt </code>
          <code> &lt/form&gt </code>
          
          <br>
          Inputs can take the form of radio buttons, check-boxes or single or multi-line text fields. Check it out!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's make a <strong> basic form </strong> that asks for a users name and opinion of our form. <br>
          First we'd add the <strong> form tag </strong> and specify a location where we'd want the information provided by our user to be sent
          for now we can set the location to a hashtag so that it is not sent anywhere. <br>
          Next the <strong>input tag</strong> will be given a property of type set to "text" which surpriseing enough specifies what type of input to show.
          We can then give the input placeholder text with the....placeholder property. <br>
          Finally we would add the <strong> buttons</strong> with the relevant input tags and a submit button. The submit button should be given a type of
          "submit". <br>
          The code and resulting html can be seen below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code> &ltform action="#"&gt </code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltlabel&gt Please Enter Your Name:&lt/label&gt  </code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltinput type="text" placeholder="name" required&gt </code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltbr&gt</code>
             <code>&nbsp Would you reccomend this form?</code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltbr&gt</code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltlabel&gt</code>
             <code>&nbsp&nbsp &ltinput type="radio"&gt Yes</code>
             <code>&nbsp &lt/label&gt</code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltlabel&gt</code>
             <code>&nbsp&nbsp &ltinput type="radio"&gt No</code>
             <code>&nbsp &lt/label&gt</code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltbr&gt</code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltbutton type="submit"&gtSubmit&lt/button&gt</code>
          <code> &lt/form&gt </code>
        </p>

        <div id="example_code">
          <form action="#">
            <label>Please Enter Your Name:</label>
            <input type="text" placeholder="name" required>
            <br>
            Would you recommend this form?
            <br>
            <label>
              <input type="radio"> Yes
            </label>  
            <br>
            <label>
              <input type="radio"> No
            </label>
            <br>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        </div>

        <p>
          Notice the <strong>label</strong> and <strong>br</strong> tags? It is considered best practice to wrap all inputs with such label tags
          and br tags (breaks) add line space. <br> 
          Also we can ensure the user provides with data in a certain field before submit by adding the <strong> required </strong> property. 
          Try clicking submit without providing a name.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p>
          There are <em>more</em> properties that should really be added to complete our form...
          Can you see any problems with our form?? <br>
          Try looking again. I'll wait. <br>
          We can both recommend AND not recommend our form! What is this mayhem. <br> 
          Well at the moment we haven't connected the radio buttons, as far the form is concerned they could be related to different
          questions hence it would be very reasonable to be able to select both. Another issue might occur to you: <em>what exactly</em>
          will be sent if the user opts for "yes" (or "no" &#128543 ), we haven't provided the code with any information on what to send 
          for a selected radio button.  <br>
          We can add a <strong>name attribute</strong> to each input; all inputs with the same name will be considered part of the
          same family and so a user will not be able to select more than one radio button. We use the <strong>value attribute</strong>
          to tell the form what information to send. 
        </p>

          <code> &ltform action="#"&gt </code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltlabel for="username"&gt Please Enter Your Name:&lt/label&gt  </code>
             <code>&nbsp &ltinput  id="username" type="text" name="username" placeholder="name" required&gt </code>

             <code>&nbsp &ltbutton type="submit"&gtSubmit&lt/button&gt</code>
          <code> &lt/form&gt </code>
        </p>

        <div id="example_code">
          <form action="#">
            <label for="username">Please Enter Your Name:</label>
            <input id="username" type="text" name="username" placeholder="name" required>
            <br>
            Would you recommend this form?
            <br>
            <label for="yes">
              <input id="yes" type="radio" name="recommend" value="yes" checked> Yes
            </label>

            <label for="no">
              <input id="no" type="radio" name="recommend" value="no"> No

            <br>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        </div>

        <p>
          Try submitting data now and then check out the url at the top of the screen. You should be able to see useful information
          has now be passed on for example <em>username="Dave"</em> and <em>recommend="yes"</em>. <br>
          Also you can see how we've added a <strong>for tag</strong> to our labels and a <strong>unique id</strong> to the inputs, 
          this associates the two (hover over the labels and see what happens). <br>
          We've also added a cheeky <strong>checked property</strong> can you guess what that does?

          I'm almost done with the personal portfolio 
          (<a href="https://codepen.io/lukeDreamtSloths/full/ZEQxoqP">here</a>), once I've got this finished I will 
          attempt to host it somewhere more permanent so I can use it to showcase all of my future work. 
          It's the first project using grid layouts which are very useful and much more straightforward compared
          with flexbox, I've also learnt how to create hover effects where the object being interacted with is not
          the one being effected (can you see the message below? can you figure out how to hide it?).  
        </p>

          I've moved my entire portfolio to github pages. For now this will do as an accpetable place to keep my work. It is far easier to maintain a local and online copy with github and it is more pleasant for viewing the websites.

          Figured out that I can just use the developer tools to examine how each project looks on any device- <em>so that's neat </em>. I've also started working through the basic JS algorithm challenges.

          I've finsihed three of the Javascript projects: a Palindrome Checker, Phone Number Validator and a Caesars Cipher. I'm on small websites to demonstrate these projects but for now my main goal is tidy up the Responsive Projects before submitting them so I can finally get my first certificate :D
